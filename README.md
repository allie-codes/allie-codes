# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Allie!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Iâ€™m a former academic editor-turned-product-minded builder with a passion for creating smart, streamlined web tools. My background blends tech, communication, and entrepreneurship â€” and Iâ€™m currently transitioning into **Product Management / Technical Program Management** roles. ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building

ðŸ”§ **AI-Powered Editing Platform** (WIP)  
A cloud-based tool for my editing business, using **Azure**, **GPT**, and full-stack automation (user auth, Stripe checkout, real-time CMS, etc.). Helping me scale while delivering better service.

ðŸ§  **Software Dev Blog**  
Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Sanity.io**, and deployed via **Vercel**. Tutorials, thoughts, and experiments for indie devs and learners.

ðŸ“š **Book Blog + Digital Shop**  
An SEO-optimised content site with a functioning e-commerce store, powered by **Stripe** and **Brevo** for email automation. Because books and tech are both core to who I am!
